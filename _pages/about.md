I'm currently an ungraduate student at Shanghai University, majoring in Cyberspace security. My interests lie broadly at incorporating deep learning techniques with other systems to drastically improve the performance. Recently, I focus on 1) preparing for the entrance examination of U-Tokyo and Kyoto-U, 2) leveraging RL to make network system more efficient.
